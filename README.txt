Preferred OS: Android
Preferred language: Kotlin or Dart 
Cross-platform development: No, unless using Flutter.io 
Team collaboration preferred: Neutral 
Project idea: Unknown (likely game-based)

I have prior experience in Android development and no personal access to iOS devices, so Android development will be the primary objective.

Collaboration with another team member with access to iOS devices makes cross-platform development a more likely possibility.

Learning Flutter.io from scratch for the purpose of cross-platform development is also a possibility.

A game-based project is suggested to revive my interest in mobile development.
